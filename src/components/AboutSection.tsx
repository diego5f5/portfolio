            I am a person passionate about technology, and now, with over 4
            years of experience in the software development field, I
            increasingly realize that I am exactly where I want to be, working
            with something that I love.
            <br />
            <br />
            During my Bachelor's degree in Information Systems, I came across
            various career options within the IT world, but I immediately
            identified with front-end development. Being able to combine
            programming logic and visual structure in their various forms is
            something that captivates me and gives me immense satisfaction.
            <br />
            <br />I am always open to learning new things and I am not afraid of
            challenges. In fact, I prefer working with challenging tasks, and I
            see this as a motivational factor during the execution of my work.
            Over these years as a front-end developer, I have developed a skill
            that I consider very important â€“ effective communication with the
            team. This way, I become a key player that connects design and
            back-end, enabling me to address issues and obstacles before they
            can arise in application development.
